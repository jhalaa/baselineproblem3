**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When items are purchased a receipt is received which lists the name of all the items
and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for sales tax are
that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to
the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
